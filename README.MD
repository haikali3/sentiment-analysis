To improve this:

1. Custom Lexicon: You could modify VADER's lexicon to adjust the sentiment score for certain phrases or words that are commonly used positively in your specific context.
2. Alternative Models: Consider using more advanced NLP models that are better at understanding context and modern language use, including positive uses of profanity.
3. Pre-processing: Implement a pre-processing step that identifies and handles common expressions like "Holy shit" as intensifiers rather than negative sentiment markers.
4. Manual Review: For critical applications, include a step for manual review of edge cases like this.
5. Fine-tuning: If using a machine learning-based sentiment analyzer, fine-tune it on a dataset that includes examples of positive uses of profanity.
